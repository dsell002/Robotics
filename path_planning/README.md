# Path Planning Techniques

This directory contains various techniques for path planning in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific path planning algorithm, providing example code and explanations.

## Directory Structure

- [A_star](A_star): Example of the A* (A-star) path planning algorithm.
- [Dijkstra](Dijkstra): Example of Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning.
- [RRT](RRT): Example of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm.
- [PRM](PRM): Example of the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm.

Each subdirectory contains a README file with detailed explanations and usage instructions.
